description: "You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?"
---

# I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! __Fatal.__ *The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed.* You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

## Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.

Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! They're like sex, except I'm having them! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.

1. Why would a robot need to drink?
2. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!
3. I'm a thing.

### You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?

Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. No, just a regular mistake. Is that a cooking show? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.

* I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.
* Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.
* Noooooo!

Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Noooooo! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!

I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?

But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home.

I'm a thing. I'll get my kit! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Bender?! You stole the atom. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

Why would I want to know that? Say it in Russian! So, how 'bout them Knicks? When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!

Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. No, she'll probably make me do it. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

Is that a cooking show? If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Hello Morbo, how's the family? Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Bite my shiny metal ass.

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Look, last night was a mistake. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Can I use the gun? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!

Shut up and get to the point! Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suitâ€¦ that's why I'm transferring to business school!

It doesn't look so shiny to me. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
